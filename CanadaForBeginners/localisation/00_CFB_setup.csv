EVTNAME44399;Canada For Beginners;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC44399;Canada is an ideal nation for new players who want to learn economic and political mechanics of the game while completely avoiding warfare until they are more comfortable with the game. It is a Constitutional Monarchy, which makes politics less punishing as you can simply appoint your preferred ruling party if you can't get the hang of elections. It has no neighboring threats and good relations with its only neighbors. It has a lot of reforms and so is unlikely to have large rebellions despite enormous population growth. It has potential to grow to a secondary power, and with that a frontier to colonize. Ideal for learning the various mechanics of the game in a safe environment. The catch is that it does not exist at game start. This event will automatically set you up as Canada though, and resolve any border disputes with the United States. You just have to click the button.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
