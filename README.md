Tutorial mod for Victoria 2

So you want to learn to play Victoria 2?

What this mod currently does:

- Sets you up automatically as Canada, a great place to learn the mechanics of the game in an independent environment

My Vision:

I want this mod to grow into a fully customizable and interactive "hands off tutorial", with events popping up to give the player advice on how they might be able to direct Canada without railroading them.

Installing this tutorial mod:

- Identify your game's installation folder. If you have Steam this will most likely be "Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Victoria 2"
- Find or create the "Victoria 2/mod" folder in that installation folder.
- Download all the files in this repository and paste them into the "mod" folder. (the readme is unnecessary though)

Playing with this mod:

- Launch the game
- Start a single player game
- Wait for the music to finish (because it is really banger)
- Select any nation on the map
- Start the game
- Press the spacebar to unpause
- An event will popup automatically setting you up as Canada

Good luck!
